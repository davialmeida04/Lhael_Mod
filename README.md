# The original Lhael Mod â€“ the all-in-one mod

Lhael Mod was originally created as a joke mod, but now it's actually a serious project.  
It focuses on adding items and blocks that were removed from the game or will likely never be added to Minecraft.

Currently, this mod is in Alpha. There are many bugs that can corrupt your world.  
**Play at your own risk.**

- Adds 2 ores, new pickaxes, and new copper tools.

Later, I will add a new dimension, more items, and much more.
